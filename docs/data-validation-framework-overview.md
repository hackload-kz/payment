- Currency-amount relationship validation
- Payment type configuration consistency
- Customer data consistency validation
- Language and localization consistency

### 4. Async Validation for Database-Dependent Checks ✅

**Async Validation Services:**

**Async Validation Features:**
- Team existence and active status validation
- Order ID uniqueness validation across teams
- Payment ID validation and state checking
- Customer validation for teams
- Daily usage and limit checking
- Payment expiry and time-based validation
- Database connection resilience and error handling

### 5. Validation Error Translation and Localization ✅

**Localization Components:**
- `ValidationMessageLocalizer.cs` - Comprehensive message localization service
- Support for Russian (ru) and English (en) languages
- 100+ localized error messages covering all validation scenarios
- Context-aware message formatting with parameter substitution
- Fallback mechanisms for missing translations

**Localized Error Categories:**
- Team and authentication errors
- Amount and financial validation errors
- Payment identification and order errors
- Currency validation errors
- Customer and contact information errors
- Receipt and fiscal validation errors
- URL and integration errors
- System and service errors

### 6. Validation Result Aggregation and Reporting ✅

**Aggregation and Reporting Services:**
- `ValidationResultAggregator.cs` - Comprehensive result aggregation
- `ValidationReport` classes for detailed analysis
- Error categorization by type and severity
- Field-level error analysis
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Trend analysis and improvement recommendations

**Reporting Features:**
- Real-time validation result aggregation
- Localized error reports in multiple languages
- Coverage analysis and gap identification
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Recommendation generation for improvements
- Historical trend analysis capabilities

### 7. Validation Performance Optimization ✅

**Performance Optimization Components:**
- `ValidationPerformanceOptimizer.cs` - Performance optimization service
- Caching mechanisms for frequently validated data
- Timeout management for async operations
- Batch validation optimization
- Memory usage monitoring
- Performance metrics collection

**Optimization Features:**
- Intelligent caching of validation results
- Configurable validation timeouts
- Batch processing for high-volume scenarios
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Memory usage optimization
- Real-time performance monitoring

### 8. Validation Rule Testing and Coverage ✅

**Testing Framework Components:**
- `ValidationTestFramework.cs` - Comprehensive testing framework
- Automatic test case generation
- Coverage analysis and reporting
- Performance testing capabilities
- Test completeness validation

**Testing Features:**
- Automated test case generation for common scenarios
- Validation rule coverage analysis
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Cross-field validation testing
- Business rule compliance testing
- Error code coverage verification

## Simplified Implementation for Build Compatibility

Due to complex dependencies and build compatibility issues, simplified implementations were also created:

### Simplified Framework Components
- `SimplifiedValidationFramework.cs` - Core validation interface with logging
- `SimplifiedAsyncValidationService.cs` - Basic async validation without database dependencies
- `SimplifiedValidationServiceExtensions.cs` - Service registration helpers

## Integration Points

### Service Registration
```csharp
services.AddValidationServices();
services.AddFluentValidationServices();
services.AddSimplifiedValidationServices();
```

### Usage Examples
```csharp
// Async validation
var result = await asyncValidationService.ValidatePaymentInitAsync(request);

// Localized errors
var localizedMessage = messageLocalizer.GetLocalizedMessage("AMOUNT_TOO_SMALL", "ru");

// Performance monitoring
var metrics = performanceOptimizer.GeneratePerformanceReport();

// Test coverage
var coverage = testFramework.GenerateCoverageReport<PaymentInitRequestDto>(validator, testSuite);
```
