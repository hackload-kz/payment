  "OrderId": "order-retry-123",
  "Success": true,
  "ErrorCode": "0",
  "Payments": [
    {
      "PaymentId": "111111111",
      "Amount": 150000,
      "Status": "REJECTED",

      "ErrorCode": "2001"
    },
    {
      "PaymentId": "222222222",
      "Amount": 150000,
      "Status": "CONFIRMED",
      "CreatedDate": "2025-01-15T10:05:00+03:00",

    }
  ]
}

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Payment Status Mapping
The Status field in each payment corresponds directly to the states in the payment lifecycle flowchart:
- **NEW**: Payment initialized but not yet processed
- **FORM_SHOWED**: Payment form displayed to customer
- **AUTHORIZING**: Payment being processed by bank
- **3DS_CHECKING**: 3D Secure authentication in progress
- **AUTHORIZED**: Payment authorized, awaiting confirmation
- **CONFIRMED**: Payment successfully completed
- **REJECTED**: Payment declined by bank
- **CANCELLED**: Payment cancelled by system or merchant
- **REVERSED**: Payment reversed (full or partial)
- **REFUNDED**: Payment refunded (full or partial)

### Use Cases
1. **Order Status Tracking**: Monitor payment progression through lifecycle states
2. **Retry Logic**: Identify failed payments and initiate new attempts
3. **Reconciliation**: Match merchant records with acquiring system states  
4. **Customer Support**: Investigate payment issues and status inquiries
5. **Webhook Validation**: Verify notification authenticity against system state

### Integration Considerations
- Method returns ALL payment attempts for an OrderId, not just the latest
- Multiple payments may exist due to retries, partial payments, or refunds
- Status progression follows the payment lifecycle flowchart sequence
- Use PaymentId from response for specific payment operations
- Implement polling mechanism for real-time status updates if webhooks unavailable

### Security Notes
- Token validation required for all requests
- Only returns payments associated with requesting terminal
- No sensitive card data included in response
- HTTPS required for all communications

This method provides comprehensive order status visibility, enabling merchants to track payments through the complete lifecycle from initialization through final settlement or cancellation.
